## About
This program takes two files filled with recipes and compares them to find any recipes that match between the two lists. Prints out the number of recipers in each list, the numbers or recipes in both lists, and the number of recipes that are only in the first list and not the second.

## How to Run
To run this program you should begin by compiling it using the following command:  
    g++ -std=c++11 <FileNameToBeCompiled>  
After that the program can be run with the following command:  
    ./a.out <FirstFileName.txt> <SecondFileName.txt>  
I have provided martastewart.txt and gordonramsay.txt for testing purposes.
